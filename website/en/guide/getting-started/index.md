## Why Choose `Aide`?

- **😩 Are you suffering from reading through the messy code left by your predecessors?**

  ✅ `Aide` can add detailed comments to your code with one click, outputting to a temporary file for you to review, thereby improving code readability.

- **🆕 Are you learning a new language or reading a project in an unfamiliar language and wish to understand the new code in a familiar language?**

  ✅ `Aide` can convert code into a familiar language with one click, outputting to a temporary file so you can immediately understand its logic.

- **📋 Do you have to manually copy multiple file codes and paste them into an AI website for questions every time?**

  ✅ `Aide` allows you to batch copy multiple files or folders with one click, saving you a lot of time.

- **🤔 Are you always dissatisfied with your variable names?**

  ✅ `Aide` can use AI to provide variable name suggestions and explanations, allowing you to choose the best practice variable names and make your code more standardized.

- **🔄 Do you often need to convert code from one format to another before pasting it into your project?**

  ✅ `Aide` can intelligently recognize code in the clipboard and guess your intent for smart pasting. For example, if you copy a `JSON` and paste it into a `TypeScript` file, it will automatically convert it to a `TypeScript` type. Or if you copy `Tailwind CSS` code and paste it into a `Flutter Dart` file, it will automatically convert it to a `Flutter Widget`, saving you a lot of time.

- **⌨️ When using command line tools similar to [`aider`](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider), do you dislike entering file paths one by one?**

  ✅ `Aide` allows you to customize AI command execution templates, passing selected file paths to the AI command, significantly saving your time.

## Differences Between `Aide` and `Copilot/Codeium/AmazonQ`

- **🚫 No Redundant Features**: We won't create a sidebar for AI chat, nor will we provide AI auto-completion features, because these are already offered by other tools. We only provide features that we can do better. `Aide` is a supplement, not a replacement.

- **⚡ Focus on Efficiency and Practicality**: `Aide` focuses on providing more efficient AI features and more practical interaction methods. Each feature is deeply thought out and designed by the author to ensure a good user experience.

- **❌ No Poor-Performing Features**: `Aide` will not offer features with poor performance, such as embedding an entire project into an AI and asking it questions. Such features usually perform poorly, so we won't offer them.

- **🔓 Open Source**: `Aide` is open source, allowing you to freely view the source code.

- **🛠️ Customizable**: `Aide` allows you to customize the AI model and even use local models.
