::: tip

`Aide` will intelligently interpret your intention, automatically recognizing and converting the content without additional configuration. For example:

- If you copy a `JSON` and paste it into a `TypeScript` file, `Aide` will automatically convert it into a `TypeScript` type definition.

- If you copy some `Tailwind CSS` code and paste it into a `Flutter Dart` file, it will automatically convert it into a `Flutter Widget`.

- You can also copy a `Python` function and paste it into a `Rust` file, and `Aide` will automatically convert it into a `Rust` function.

Of course, its functionalities are not limited to these examples. Feel free to explore more use cases.

**Examples:**

- **From `JSON` to `TypeScript` Type**

Suppose you have the following `JSON` data:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "isAdmin": true
}
```

Copy it to the clipboard, then use the `Smart Paste` feature in a `TypeScript` file, and `Aide` will automatically convert it into a `TypeScript` type definition:

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string
  age: number
  isAdmin: boolean
}
```

- **From `Tailwind CSS` to `Flutter Widget`**

Suppose you have the following `Tailwind CSS` code:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">Hello, World!</div>
```

Copy it to the clipboard, then use the `Smart Paste` feature in a `Flutter Dart` file, and `Aide` will automatically convert it into a `Flutter Widget`:

```dart
Container(
  color: Colors.blue,
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
  child: Text(
    'Hello, World!',
    style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
  ),
)
```
